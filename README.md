**Project Summary:** New Year Sales Analysis

**Objective:**

This project involved a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a New Year sales dataset. The primary goal was to clean the data, identify key sales metrics, and uncover actionable insights into customer behavior by analyzing demographics such as gender, age, state, marital status, and occupation.

# Methodology:

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter notebook using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn. The process included:

**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, correcting data types, and standardizing column names.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total orders, and average order value.

**Visual Analysis:** Creating various plots (bar charts, count plots) to visualize patterns in sales distribution across different demographic segments and product categories.

**Key Findings:**

The analysis successfully identified a primary customer profile and key market drivers:

**Key Demographic:** The most significant customer group consists of married women between the ages of 26 and 35.

**Top Occupations:** Customers from the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors are the highest contributors to sales.

**Geographical Hotspots:** The top three states driving the highest number of orders and revenue are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

**Top-Selling Products:** The most popular product categories are Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets, with Food being the highest-grossing category.

# Conclusion & Business Impact:

The analysis concluded that marketing and sales efforts should be strategically targeted at married women aged 26-35 in key states and professional sectors. The insights gained provide a clear roadmap for tailoring marketing campaigns, optimizing inventory management for high-demand products, and developing region-specific sales strategies to maximize revenue in future sales events. The cleaned dataset was also prepared for further use by exporting it to a CSV file and a PostgreSQL database.
